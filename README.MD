[![Live Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/live-demo-brightgreen)](https://pari-o-dispari.netlify.app/)

This project is a simple web-based "Even or Odd" game. It was originally developed as a JavaScript exercise, where the game logic worked only through prompts and console output. In this updated version, the game interacts directly with the DOM, providing a more user-friendly experience with real-time feedback on the web page.

## How to Play

1. Enter a number between 1 and 100 in the input box.
2. Enter your guess: either "pari" (even) or "dispari" (odd) in the second input box.
3. Click the "invia" (send) button.
4. The computer will randomly generate a number between 1 and 100.
5. The sum of your number and the computer's number will be calculated.
6. The game will display:
   - Your chosen number
   - Your guess (even or odd)
   - The computer's number
   - The sum of both numbers
   - Whether the sum is even or odd
   - Who won (you or the computer)

## Features

- Input validation for both the number and the guess.
- Real-time display of results in the browser (DOM manipulation).
- Improved user experience compared to the original console-based version.

## Tech Stack
